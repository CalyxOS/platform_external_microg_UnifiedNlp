Install additional backends, just search for NLP on F-Droid\n2. Build with 5573, but without this change.\n3. Install build, you\u0027ll notice Mozilla and Dejavu are now off even if they were on before. Verify from shared_prefs/unified_nlp.xml, they\u0027ll have the old signatures there.\n4. adb install this-patch.apk\n5. They\u0027ll be back on, if you verify unified_nlp.xml, it\u0027ll have the new signatures.\n\nThis can then just get reverted in later builds since we\u0027re forcing everyone to upgrade to this build.",
